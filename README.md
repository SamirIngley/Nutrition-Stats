# NutriBasket
A chrome extension that keeps track of a shopping cart's cumulative nutritional value.

NutriBasket provides the user with total counts for 12 different micro and macronutrients while allowing them to set a limit for each one. After setting a personal limit or 'goal' for each nutrient NutriBasket will alert the user so that they can either delete items and change or add new ones.
